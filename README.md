# ML-Project
AI/ML-Based Model for Predicting Prices of Agri-Horticultural Commodities
üìå Project Overview
Agricultural and horticultural commodity prices are highly volatile due to seasonal changes, weather conditions, supply-demand variations, and market dynamics. Accurate price forecasting is essential for farmers, traders, policymakers, and consumers to make informed decisions.

This project develops a Machine Learning (ML) based price prediction model that leverages historical market data, climatic factors, and other relevant parameters to predict future prices for various agri-horticultural commodities.

üéØ Objectives
Predict near-term and medium-term prices of selected commodities.

Provide insights into price trends to assist farmers and market stakeholders.

Integrate external influencing factors like weather patterns, seasonal cycles, and market demand.

Offer an easy-to-use prediction interface (optional dashboard/web app).
