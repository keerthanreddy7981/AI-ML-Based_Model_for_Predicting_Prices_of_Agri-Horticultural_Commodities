# ML-Project
 AI/ML-Based Model for Predicting Prices of Agri-Horticultural Commodities
 Project Overview :
Agricultural and horticultural commodity prices are highly volatile due to:

Seasonal changes

Weather conditions

Supply-demand variations

Market dynamics

Accurate price forecasting helps:

Farmers

Traders

Policymakers

Consumers

This project builds a Machine Learning-based price prediction model using:

Historical market data

Climatic factors

Other relevant parameters

Goal: Predict future prices for various agri-horticultural commodities.

 Objectives :
Predict near-term and medium-term commodity prices.

Provide price trend insights to assist farmers and stakeholders.

Integrate external factors:

Weather patterns

Seasonal cycles

Market demand
